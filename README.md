iKALiZER audio engine - archive only

iKALiZER is an "old" audio engine in the form of an external library intended primarily for video games and which can be used by Urban Terror (and Quake 3 / ioQuake) as an alternative audio engine.
I leave the source code here for informational, educational, research, and archival purposes.
